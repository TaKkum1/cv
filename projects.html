    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>The Automatic Irrigation System              &nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                              March 2020 - May 2020</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed an irrigation system automatically watering, temperature controlling, changing pH value, illuminating for a spider plant, 
                    <br>which are fully controlled by Arduino through humidity sensor, temperature sensor, pH sensor, and the sunlight intensity sensor.</li>
                <li>Tested the code of the pH sensor in C/C++ on Arduino Uno. Used scripting language to test what substances can increase or decrease pH quickly 
                    <br>and do less damage to the plant and spider plant.</li>
                <li>Adding baking soda when pH is lower than 6.0, and vinegar will be added when pH is above 6.5. And when the pushbutton was pressed,
                    <br> the OLED display will show the pH value for 3 seconds.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h4>The Battle-Bot</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed an 8x6x5 inches rear drive battle-bot with a hammer by using the System Development Life Cycle. The hammer is installed at 
                    <br>top of the battle-bot and controlled by another motor.</li>
                <li>Analyzed whether hammer or a saw is better for a combat. Programmed the code of controlling the hammer using C on Arduino and the 
                    <br>power of hammer by changing the speed of motor and height of hammer. And debugged battle-bot when controller was unable to control the battle-bot.</li>
                <li>Coordinating the balance of speed of motor and height of hammer to maximum the hammer damage. Battle-bot have a more stable connection 
                    <br>with controller by reinforcing. Reproduce and enhance the battle-bot by repeating test.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Carrying Boe-Bot</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a 6x4x4 inches carrying Boe-Bot that can clamp an empty can and move when it capture high decibel sounds.</li>
                <li>Tested the minimum distance that the Boe-Bot need to take a turn when receive the Ultrasonic sensor signal. Also, I tested what sensors 
                    <br>are ideal for detecting the target object through different factors, including distance between Boe-Bot and empty can, can temperature, signal angle, and object size.</li>
                <li>Making a 90 degrees right turn when the ultrasonic sensor receive the signal after detected anything is within 10 of the bot on the horizontal.
                    <br> So that the Boe-Bot can ensure its own safety when transporting objects by capturing sounds through the sound sensor.</li>
            </ul>
